# Juliet-Group
 CryptoCurrency App with database 

*Have to use 2D lists to store the data*

~8 Key Items~
- First 5 is group work (Both need to know what each person is doing)
    - The marks for these the 2 group mates will share
    - Only python coding 

- 6, 7 about functions 
    - One person can do each (The other person doesn't have to know everything about it)
    - The one you do will affect personal grade and not the group 
    - Can use librarys for these
